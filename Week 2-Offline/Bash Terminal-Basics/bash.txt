What is a Terminal?
A terminal is a command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to interact with the operating system by typing commands instead of using a graphical user interface (GUI). It is a text-based environment where users can run commands to navigate files, execute programs, and manage the system.

🔹 Examples of Terminals:

Linux/macOS: Terminal, Konsole, GNOME Terminal

Windows: Command Prompt (cmd), PowerShell, Windows Terminal

What is Bash?
Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is a command-line interpreter (shell) for Unix-based operating systems. It interprets user commands and executes them in the system. Bash is one of the most widely used shells in Linux and macOS.

🔹 Key Features of Bash:
✔️ Supports scripting (Bash scripts)
✔️ Command history & autocompletion
✔️ Supports loops, conditions, and variables
